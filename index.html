<h1> What's your EDM Story?!</h1>
<h6> Share your EDM Festival stories here, find that girl or guy you met, but then lost, create fest groups! </h6>

<p> EDMFS (EDM Festival Story) is a place where fest lovers come together to share their favorite EDM festival stores, try and find those girls or guys they met and had that magic, but lost in the crowd, or try and create your new or improve your rave group and travel the world to other festivals together. </p>

<p> You can submit content in our forms below, and we'll review and post your story for you, try and rekindle that magic that you lost, or help you find some groups you want to go to that one festival with! </p>

<p> I'll kick start this community. First, here is a list of festivals that I have been to so far, and followed by a list of festivals I want to go to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spring Awakening</li>
<li> North Coast </li>
<li> FreakyDeaky </li>
</ul>

<p> Spring Awakening was my first festival experience and it was life changing. I won't get too deep on it, but it was amazing to see the diverse culture and community and see how much love everyone had for one another, coming together and enjoying the event, respecting each other's differences, opinions, background, etc. 

North Coast was when I had that first magical moment with some girl from Arizona (unfortunately) during Odesza's set. We stayed connected, but don't live near each other.

FreakyDeaky was when I had another falling in love moment with someone during an amazing set, but unfortuatnlely we lost each other after a while. I'll never know what could have been, or could I.....</p>

<p>Here's the list of future fests I will attempt to go to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Electric Forest (next to attend) </li>
<li> EDC Las Vegas </li>
<li><a href="https://www.tomorrowland.com/global/"> Tomorrowland Belgium </a> (Dream fest to attend, looking for Chicago folks to go with. See images below. =) </li>
</ul>
